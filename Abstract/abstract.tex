	The main focus of this thesis is the search for new physics signal in the
	LHC proton–proton collisions data collected by the ATLAS detector at 
	the Large Hadron Collider located in CERN.\\
	A flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) top-quark decay
	$\Pqt\rightarrow\PZ\Pqc$ is searched as signal of new physics using 
	top-quark–top-antiquark pair production events with one top quark 
	decaying through the $\Pqt\rightarrow\PZ\Pqc$ channel and the other 
	through the dominant Standard Model mode\\ $\Pqt\rightarrow\PW\Pqb$. 
	Only Z boson decays into charged leptons and leptonic W boson decays 
	are considered as signal.\\
	The FCNC processes are forbidden at tree-level and extremely suppressed at loop-level 
	which is why they are very rare phenomena in the Standard Model of particle physics.
	However, this processes have an higher probability to occur in several models beyond the Standard Model where the suppression could be relaxed and the loop diagrams mediated by new bosons that could contribute.\\
	The analyzed data were recorded at a center-of-mass energy of \SI{13}{\TeV} and correspond to the full Run-2 dataset with an integrated luminosity of \SI{139}{\ifb}.\\
	The expected upper limit at 95\% CL is set at $\mathrm{BR (\Pqt\rightarrow\PZ\Pqc)=\SI{9.6e-5}{}}$, improving the previous ATLAS results by a factor of 3.3.
