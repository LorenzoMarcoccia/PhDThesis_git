This chapter presents the Signal Regions dedicated to FCNC \tZc in \ttbar decays and single-top production using vetoes on \Pqc-tagged jets.
Background sources are also described as well as the definitions of several Control Regions.

\section{Event selections and reconstruction}
\label{sec:selection_all}
The pre-selection criteria, common to all the Signal Regions used in this work were already discussed in Cref{sec:selection}.
In this section, the topology of the final states of the signal in the signal regions are described. 
The SR3\tZc selection using the \Pqc-tagger \DLrc is already presented in \Cref{sec:other_selection}.\\
There are two more channels that remain to present.
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\\The first channel is \FCNCtZc in \ttbar decays, where one of the \Pqt-quarks decays following the SM into a \PW boson and a
\Pqb-quark (called in the following \textit{SM top}), while the other
\Pqt-quark (called in the following \textit{FCNC top}) decays into a \PZ
boson and a \Pqc-quark. Only the
trileptonic channel is considered, i.e. when the \PZ boson from the
FCNC top decays leptonically and the \PW boson from the SM top
decays leptonically. Therefore the final state is characterised by
the presence of three leptons, a \Pqc-jet, a \Pqb-tagged jet and missing
transverse momentum from the escaping neutrino.  
The final state of this channel was already presented in \Cref{sec:selection}  with the exception that no SMT or \Pqc-tagged jet is required.
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\\The second channel is \FCNCtZc in single-top production, where the
production of a single top-quark proceeds through an FCNC
interaction. The \Pqt-quark is produced in association with a \PZ
boson. Also in this case only the trileptonic channel is
considered. Therefore the final state is characterised by
the presence of three leptons, a \Pqb-tagged jet and missing
transverse momentum from the escaping neutrino. 

\subsection {Top quarks reconstruction}
In the events having at least two jets with one of them being \Pqb-tagged, two top quarks (FCNC and SM tops) candidates are reconstructed under the FCNC \ttbar decay signal hypothesis.
The kinematics of the top-quark candidates can be reconstructed from
the corresponding decay particles using~\Cref{eq:chi2tt} in~\Cref{sec:sel:topmassrec} as well more other details about the Top quarks reconstruction
The SM top quark candidate is reconstructed under the FCNC single-top quark production hypothesis in the events having one or two jets with exactly one being $b$-tagged,
which is assumed to come from the top-quark decay ($t\to bW$). 
The lepton not used to reconstruct the \PZ boson is assumed to be the one coming from \PW boson decay
and the missing transverse momentum is assumed to be the transverse momentum of the neutrino from \PW boson decay,
while the most probable value for the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is determined using the minimisation of the following expression:
\begin{equation}
\chi^2_{\tZ}  = 
\frac{\left(m^{\mathrm{reco}}_{b\ell_W\nu}-m_{t_{\mathrm{SM}}}\right)^2}{\sigma_{t_{\mathrm{SM}}}^2}
+ \frac{\left(m^{\mathrm{reco}}_{\ell_W\nu}-m_W\right)^2}{\sigma_W^2},
\label{eq:chi2tZ}
\end{equation}
where $m^{\mathrm{reco}}_{j_b\ell_W\nu}$ and $m^{\mathrm{reco}}_{\ell_W\nu}$ are 
the reconstructed masses of the $bW$ and $\ell_W\nu$ systems, respectively.
In~\cref{eq:chi2tZ}, the central value for the masses and the widths
of the top quark and $W$ boson are
the same as in~\cref{eq:chi2tt}, therefore, in the events with two jets,
the four-momentum of SM top-quark candidate reconstructed under the FCNC single-top quark
production signal hypothesis is the same as the one
reconstructed under the FCNC \ttbar decay signal hypothesis.\\
The mass cuts are applied on the reconstructed top-quark candidates in the signal regions as described in the following sections.\\
The overview of the requirements applied for selecting events in all the signal regions is shown in Table~\ref{tab:sel:srs}. 

\subsection{SR1 selections}
\label{sec:sel:sr1}
The SR1 have the following additional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item At least two jets satisfying the requirements described in 
	\Cref{sec:object:jet}. 
	\item Exactly one \Pqb-jet satisfying the requirements
	described in \Cref{sec:object:bjet}. 
	\item The mass of the FCNC top-quark candidate,
	\mtopfcnc, must be within $2\sigma^{FCNC}$ from \mtopvalue, while no
	requirement on the mass of the SM top-quark candidate, \mtopsm, is applied. 
\end{itemize}
In the SR1\tZc region there is also a veto of events where there is a \Pqc-tagged jet described in~\Cref{sec:object:cjet}.  Kinematic plots are presented in \Cref{app:SRs:SR1}.

% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{SR2 selections}
\label{sec:sel:sr2}

The SR2s (both SR2\tZu and SR2\tZc) have the following additional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exactly one or two jets satisfying the requirements described in 
	\Cref{sec:object:jet}. 
	\item Exactly one \Pqb-jet satisfying the requirements
	described in \Cref{sec:object:bjet}. 
	\item The lepton not used to reconstruct the \PZ boson is assumed to be
	the one coming from the \PW boson.
	The transverse mass is calculated using the momentum of the lepton associated with the $W$ boson, $\MET$ and azimuthal angle,$\phi$, between them: 
	$\mT(\ell_{\PW},\Pgn) = \sqrt{2\pT^{\ell}\MET \left(1-\cos\Delta\phi\right)}$.
	Events are required to have $\mT(\ell_{\PW},\Pgn) > \SI{40}{\GeV}$.
	\item For events with exactly one jet, no
	requirement is applied on the massed of the FCNC and SM top-quark
	candidates. For events with exactly two jets, the mass of the FCNC
	top-quark candidate, \mtopfcnc, must be outside $2\sigma^{FCNC}$
	from \mtopvalue, while the mass of the SM top-quark candidate,
	\mtopsm, must be within $2\sigma^{SM}$ from \mtopvalue. The
	requirement on \mtopfcnc makes this region orthogonal to SR1.
\end{itemize}
In the SR2\tZc region there is also a veto of events where there is a \Pqc-tagged jet described in~\Cref{sec:object:cjet}.  Kinematic plots are presented in \Cref{app:SRs:SR2}.

\subsection{Event yields in the Signal Regions}
Event yields in the SRs for the \tZc coupling extraction are reported in Table~\ref{tab:sel:yields:tzc}.

As it can be noticed, the main background sources are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item for SR1s (both SR1\tZu and SR1\tZc), \ttZ and \VVHF;
	\item for SR2s (both SR2\tZu and SR2\tZc), \VVHF and Standard Model \tZq ;
	\item for SR3, \ttZ.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background estimation}
\label{sec:background_all}
A variety of background sources are considered and already discussed in \Cref{sec:background}.
In order to study the modelling of the main background samples, Control regions (CRs) are used in the fit to extract the normalisation of some relevant background sources.\\
Several CRs are defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \ttbar CR is designed to control the minor \ttbar
	background. As previously mentioned, this background enters the
	selection because of the presence of a mis-reconstructed lepton,
	i.e. a fake lepton. Since this background is small, the decision was
	taken to evaluate it using MC. Nevertheless, the normalisation is
	taken from data. 
	\item \ttZ CR is designed to control the \ttZ
	background. It is constructed by requiring the presence of more jets
	with respect to the jet multiplicity required in the SRs.
	\item Side-band CRs are designed to contain a mixture
	of the main background sources (\ttZ and diboson). They are
	constructed applying cuts on the top mass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Control Regions definition}
\label{sec:bkg:sel}
In the following, the event selection in the CRs is described.\\
\Cref{tab:bkg:crs} summarises the selection cuts in the various CRs.
\paragraph{\ttbar CR selections}
The \ttbar CR is defined by requiring that there is at least one pair
of opposite-sign but different-flavour leptons in the
event. Obviously, no cut on the invariant mass of the opposite-sign
leptons is applied. Concerning the jet multiplicity, there should be
at least one jet in the event, of which exactly one should be
\Pqb-tagged. Kinematic plots are presented in \Cref{app:CRs:tt}.

\paragraph{\ttZ CR selections}
\label{sec:bkg:ttz}
The \ttZ CR is defined by requiring the presence of at least four jets
and of exactly two \Pqb-tagged jets. Also the cut on the transverse
mass of the \PW boson is softened to \SI{30}{\GeV}. To be orthogonal 
with SR3, also a veto on the presence of a \Pqc-jet is required. 
Kinematic plots are presented in \Cref{app:CRs:ttZ}.

\paragraph{Side-band CR1 selections}
\label{sec:bkg:sbcr1tzu}
The mass side-band CR1 is defined by requiring the presence of at least two jets
and of exactly one \Pqb-tagged jet.
The mass of the FCNC top-quark candidate, \mtopfcnc,
must be outside $2\sigma^{FCNC}$ from \mtopvalue, the mass of the
SM top-quark candidate, \mtopsm, must be also outside $2\sigma^{SM}$
from \mtopvalue.  In addition, a veto on the presence of a \Pqc-jet is required. 
Kinematic plots are presented in \Cref{app:CRs:SB1}.

\paragraph{Side-band CR2 selections}
\label{sec:bkg:sbcr2}
The mass side-band CR2 is defined by requiring the presence of exactly one or two jets
and of exactly one \Pqb-tagged jet.   The transverse mass is calculated using the momentum of the lepton associated with the $W$ boson, $\MET$ and azimuthal angle,$\phi$, between them: 
$\mT(\ell_{\PW},\Pgn) = \sqrt{2\pT^{\ell}\MET \left(1-\cos\Delta\phi\right)}$.
Events are required to have $\mT(\ell_{\PW},\Pgn) > \SI{40}{\GeV}$.\\
The mass of the SM top-quark candidate, \mtopsm, must be also outside $2\sigma^{SM}$
from \mtopvalue. Kinematic plots are presented in \Cref{app:CRs:SB2}.

\subsection{Event yields in the Control Regions}
Event yields in the CRs are shown in \Cref{tab:bkg:yields:tzc}. 
As it can be noticed, the signal contribution in the various CRs is small.
Every Control Region is enriched of the correspondent background.

%\subsection {Fake composition}
%The origin of the three leptons from \ttbar events was studied, to
%understand where the fake leptons come from and eventually define an
%uncertainty to take into account the different sources in the signal
%and control regions. The origin of the three leptons from \ttbar
%events is shown in \cref{fig:bkg:fakes:ttbar:comp}. As it can be
%seen, apart from the leptons for which the mother is the top quark
%(\SI{66}{\%} of the leptons in each event), the fake leptons come from
%either photon conversions (around \SI{5}{\%}, depending on the region)
%or from \Pqb-hadrons (around \SI{25}{\%}, depending on the region). \\
%Some differences can be noticed for the photon conversion and
%\Pqb-hadron fractions in the signal regions with respect to the \ttbar
%control region where the \ttbar background is controlled. To take into
%account this differences, a systematic uncertainties is added.
